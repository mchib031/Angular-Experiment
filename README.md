# Angular Experiment

This branch is part of an angular experimen. Here I will display how we use angular pipes for data formating
## Pipes options
The "|" is the operator for pipes
Use it followed by the pipe name to apply a pipe on your data you can either use pipes pre-defined by angular or generate a new pipe.

## Generating a pipe
ng g p <pipe-name>
This creates a .pipe.spec.ts and .pipe.ts in /src/app you can customize the pipe there
