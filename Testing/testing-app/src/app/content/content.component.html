<p>content works!</p>
<!ng content with multiple selectors>
<ng-content [selector1]></ng-content>
<ng-content [selector2]></ng-content>

<!template statements, pass events if you want to get specifics in the component such as form values>
<button (click)="toggleText($event)">Toggle Text</button>
{{showText}}
